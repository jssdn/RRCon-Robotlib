This example creates a single periodic realtime Orocos TaskContext that queries the ADC and displays the current temperature.

The Makefile assumes that the cross compiled build system is present in /usr/local/ppc_4xx/build. CHANGE this to reflect your path if it is neccessary. Also, edit the Makefile and insert the appropriate path where you have installed librobot.

This example won't be included in the main Makefile due to the use of Orocos.
